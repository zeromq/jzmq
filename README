This is the Java language binding for 0MQ.

To build, run:

./configure
make

To build Debian package run:

$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

To build RPM package run:

$ rpmbuild -tb jzmq-X.Y.Z.tar.gz 

Where X.Y.Z is replaced with the version that you've downloaded.

If your zmq installation is not found by configure you can add this information manually e.g. --with-zeromq=/usr/local/lib.
 
You may want to take a look at http://www.zeromq.org/docs:tuning-zeromq for additional hints.

For more information, refer to the 0MQ website at http://www.zeromq.org/.

On Mac OS X you may need to compile and make install pkg-config if configure fails with "syntax error near unexpected token `newline'". See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3522248/how-do-i-compile-jzmq-for-zeromq-on-osx for details. You may also need to symlink the header files of your standard Java installation (e.g. /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK/Headers/*.h) into a suitable directory (e.g. /usr/local/include) and point the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the parent directory (e.g. /usr/local).
